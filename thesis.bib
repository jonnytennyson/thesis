  Abstract = {{Protein folding is inherently a heterogeneous process because of the
   very large number of microscopic pathways that connect the myriad
   unfolded conformations to the unique conformation of the native
   structure. In a first step towards the long-range goal of describing the
   distribution of pathways experimentally, Forster resonance energy
   transfer(1) (FRET) has been measured on single, freely diffusing
   molecules(2-4). Here we use this method to determine properties of the
   free-energy surface for folding that have not been obtained from
   ensemble experiments. We show that single-molecule FRET measurements of
   a small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse of the unfolded
   polypeptide and allow us to calculate limits on the polypeptide
   reconfiguration time. From these results, limits on the height of the
   free-energy barrier to folding are obtained that are consistent with a
   simple statistical mechanical model, but not with the barriers derived
   from simulations using molecular dynamics. Unlike the activation energy,
   the free-energy barrier includes the activation entropy and thus has
   been elusive to experimental determination for any kinetic process in
   solution.}},

 Year = {{2005}},
 Volume = {{54}},
 Number = {{3}},
 Pages = {{469-496}},
 Abstract = {{Recent advances in experimental technologies allow scientists to follow
   biochemical processes on a single-molecule basis, which provides much
   richer information about chemical dynamics than traditional
   ensemble-averaged experiments but also raises many new statistical
   challenges. The paper provides the first likelihood-based statistical
   analysis of the single-molecule fluorescence lifetime experiment
   designed to probe the conformational dynamics of a single
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hairpin molecule. The conformational change
   is initially treated as a continuous time two-state Markov chain, which
   is not observable and must be inferred from changes in photon emissions.
   This model is further complicated by unobserved molecular Brownian
   diffusions. Beyond the simple two-state model, a competing model that
   models the energy barrier between the two states of the DNA hairpin as
   an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process has been suggested in the literature. We
   first derive the likelihood function of the simple two-state model and
   then generalize the method to handle complications such as unobserved
   molecular diffusions and the fluctuating energy barrier. The data
   augmentation technique and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are
   developed to sample from the posterior distribution desired. The Bayes
   factor calculation and posterior estimates of relevant parameters
   indicate that the fluctuating barrier model fits the data better than
   the simple two-state model.}},

  Abstract = {{In this article, we demonstrate the new method of pulsed interleaved
   excitation (PIE), which can be used to extend the capabilities of
   multiple-color fluorescence imaging, fluorescence cross-correlation
   spectroscopy (FCCS), and single-pair fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer (spFRET) measurements. In PIE, multiple excitation sources are
   interleaved such that the fluorescence emission generated from one pulse
   is complete before the next excitation pulse arrives. Hence, the
   excitation source for each detected photon is known. Typical repetition
   rates used for PIE are between similar to 1 and 50 MHz. PIE has many
   applications in various fluorescence methods. Using PIE, dual-color
   measurements can be performed with a single detector. In fluorescence
   imaging with multicolor detection, spectral cross talk can be removed,
   improving the contrast of the image. Using PIE with FCCS, we can
   eliminate spectral cross talk, making the method sensitive to weaker
   interactions. FCCS measurements with complexes that undergo FRET can be
   analyzed quantitatively. Under specific conditions, the FRET efficiency
   can be determined directly from the amplitude of the measured
   correlation functions without any calibration factors. We also show the
   application of PIE to spFRET measurements, where complexes that have low
   FRET efficiency can be distinguished from those that do not have an
   active acceptor.}},

   scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is used to obtain simultaneous dual

   linked by a short DNA molecule. Photodestruction dynamics of the donor
   or acceptor are used to determine the presence and efficiency of energy
   transfer, The classical equations used to measure energy transfer on
   ensembles of fluorophores are modified for single-molecule measurements.
   In contrast to ensemble measurements, dynamic events on a molecular
   scale are observable in single pair FRET measurements because they are
   not canceled out by random averaging, Monitoring conformational changes,
   such as rotations and distance changes on a nanometer scale, within

    Abstract = {{We describe a simple approach and present a straightforward numerical
   algorithm to compute the best fit shot-noise limited proximity ratio
   histogram (PRH) in single-molecule fluorescence resonant energy transfer
   diffusion experiments. The key ingredient is the use of the experimental
   burst size distribution, as obtained after burst search through the
   photon data streams. We show how the use of an alternated laser
   excitation scheme and a correspondingly optimized burst search algorithm
   eliminates several potential artifacts affecting the calculation of the
   best fit shot-noise limited PRH. This algorithm is tested extensively on
   simulations and simple experimental systems. We find that dsDNA data
   exhibit a wider PRH than expected from shot noise only and
   hypothetically account for it by assuming a small Gaussian distribution
   of distances with an average standard deviation of 1.6 angstrom.
   Finally, we briefly mention the results of a future publication and
   illustrate them with a simple two-state model system (DNA hairpin), for
   which the kinetic transition rates between the open and closed
   conformations are extracted.}},

	volume = {97},
	number = {15},
	abstract = {Diffusion of molecules in brain extracellular space is constrained by two macroscopic parameters, tortuosity factor lambda and volume fraction alpha. Recent studies in brain slices show that when osmolarity is reduced, lambda increases while alpha decreases. In contrast, with increased osmolarity, alpha increases, but lambda attains a plateau. Using homogenization theory and a variety of lattice models, we found that the plateau behavior of lambda can be explained if the shape of brain cells changes nonuniformly during the shrinking or swelling induced by osmotic challenge. The nonuniform cellular shrinkage creates residual extracellular space that temporarily traps diffusing molecules, thus impeding the macroscopic diffusion. The paper also discusses the definition of tortuosity and its independence of the measurement frame of reference.},

	abstract = {We present theoretical calculations relating the effective diffusivity of monoclonal antibodies in tissue (Deff) to the actual diffusivity in the interstitium (Dint) and the interstitial volume fraction phi. Measured diffusivity values are effective values, deduced from concentration profiles with the tissue treated as a continuum. By using homogenization theory, the ratio Deff/Dint is calculated for a range of interstitial volume fractions from 10 to 65\%. It is assumed that only diffusion in the interstitial spaces between cells contributes to the effective diffusivity. The geometries considered have cuboidal cells arranged periodically, with uniform gaps between cells. Deff/Dint is found to generally be between (2/3) phi and phi for these geometries. In general, the pathways for diffusion between cells are not straight. The effect of winding pathways on Deff/Dint is examined by varying the arrangement of the cells, and found to be slight. Also, the estimates of Deff/Dint are shown to be insensitive to typical nonuniformities in the widths of gaps between cells. From our calculations and from published experimental measurements of the effective diffusivity of an IgG polyclonal antibody both in water and in tumor tissue, we deduce that the diffusivity of this molecule in the interstitium is one-tenth to one-twentieth its diffusivity in water. We also conclude that exclusion of molecules from cells (an effect independent of molecular weight) contributes as much as interstitial hindrance to the reduction of effective diffusivity, for small interstitial volume fractions (around 20\%). This suggests that the increase in the rate of delivery to tissues resulting from the use of smaller molecular-weight molecules (such as antibody fragments or bifunctional antibodies) may be less than expected.},
