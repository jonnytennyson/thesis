\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusions}

This thesis presents three years' work on understanding and improving the analysis tools used in confocal sFRET experiments. Much of this work has involved benchmarking existing techniques, as well as implementing and thoroughly evaluating novel methodologies. We hope that this work provides a strong foundation for other researchers working in this field.
