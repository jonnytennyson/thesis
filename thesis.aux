\newlabel{fig:illumina}{{5.2}{143}{Sequencing by synthesis. A) DNA fragments are generated and joined to a pair of oligonucleotides. The ligated products are amplified using two oligonucleotide primers, resulting in double-stranded blunt-ended material with a different adaptor sequence on either end. B) DNA fragments are denatured and single strands are annealed to complementary oligonucleotides on the flow-cell surface. A new strand is copied from the original strand in an extension reaction; the original strand is then removed by denaturation.
