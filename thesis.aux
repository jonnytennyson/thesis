The global variables $\lambda _{D}$ and $\lambda _{A}$ are the background emission rates of donor and acceptor photons; $\lambda _{prot}$ is the rate of observation of fluorescent molecules; $p_{D}$ and $p_{A}$ are the probability that a molecule carries respectively a donor and an acceptor dye; $\lambda _B$ and $k_D$ are the parameters of the Gamma-distribution, from which the local donor emission rate, $\lambda $ is selected. Each random variable is initialized using a prior selected from a uniform distribution across the indicated ranges. The two known constants $R_0$ and $\gamma $ are the dye-separation for which FRET efficiency is 50 \% and the instrumental $\gamma $-factor discussed above}{figure.3.7}{}}
